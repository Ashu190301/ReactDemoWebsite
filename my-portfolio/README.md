# About 

This is a react web app I was practicing in. The main feature is the theme changer i.e., you can change the background to either light theme or dark theme.

## To-dos

In the about section , the background shadow of the flower image needs to be removed when the maxwidth of the screen reaches 480 pixels.

**Note**
 
 You may take references from [React](https://reactjs.org/)
